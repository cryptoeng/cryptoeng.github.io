[{"content":"We extend the libcrux cryptographic library with support for resource constrained IoT devices. The libcrux-iot library contains high performance, high assurance implementations of post-quantum, as well as classical, cryptographic primitives.\nThe project is supported by the German innovation programme for small and medium-sized enterprises (ZIM). The library will be launched with our partner Crypto Quantique. Crypto Quantique will use libcrux-iot in their IoT software platform, which enables device manufacturers and OEMs to connect and manage their devices to multiple cloud service providers with ease.\nReach out if you are interested in licensing the libcrux-iot library to secure your connections with high-performance, high-assurance post-quantum cryptography.\n","permalink":"https://cryptoeng.de/blog/posts/iot-pqc-announce/","summary":"We extend the libcrux cryptographic library with support for resource constrained IoT devices.
